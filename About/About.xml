  <description>
Your colonists will automatically strip corpses of their weapons, equipment, and apparel upon hauling them.

Ideal for scavenger or cannibal colonies who don't want to manually assign strip orders after every battle!

Tainted apparel (smeltable and non-smeltable separate) can be configured to be auto-forbidden, or auto-magically destroyed upon haul as well!

For those who would rather not deal with tons of useless tainted clothes after every battle!

*Optimized for performance.
*Safe to add and remove mid-game.
*CE compatible.
*No conflicts since this is an independent feature addition.

~1.3 update:
Added strip after haul option.

~1.2 update:
Added auto-forbid equipment option.

~1.1 update:
Added auto-forbid tainted option. Added auto-destroy smeltables option.
