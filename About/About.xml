  <description>
Your pawns will automatically strip corpses of their weapons, useable equipment (ie: belts, grenades, utility), and smeltable apparel (ie: metallic helmets, armor) upon hauling them.

Ideal for scavenger or cannibal colonies that don't want to manually assign strip orders after every battle!

The amount of tainted non-smeltable apparel (ie: tainted cloth/leather t-shirts, hats, pants) stripped can be optionally configured as well. For those who would rather not deal with tons of useless tainted clothes after every battle!

*Optimized for performance.
*Safe to add and remove mid-game.
*Rocketman compatible.
*CE compatible.
*No conflicts since this is an independent feature addition.
