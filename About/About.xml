Your colonists will automatically strip corpses of their weapons, equipment, inventory, and apparel upon hauling them.
Ideal for scavenger or cannibal colonies who don't want to manually assign strip orders after every battle!

Tainted apparel (smeltable and non-smeltable separate) can be configured to be auto-forbidden, or auto-magically destroyed upon haul as well.
For those who would rather not deal with tons of useless tainted clothes after every battle!

Also patches the Burn Apparel and Burn Weapon recipes to not include smeltables by default, so smeltables don't get burned by mistake.

*0% performance impact (0.000ms per strip in Dub's Performance Analyzer).
*Makes no changes to your saved-game! Completely safe to add and remove mid-game.
*Confirmed compatible with CE, Vanilla Expanded series, Alpha series, and Humanoid Alien Races.
*Should be no incompatibilities with other mods since this is entirely an independent feature addition.

(Steam workshop can be slow/janky at detecting updated mods. If the mod doesn't update, unsubscribe, wait a few seconds, and resubscribe to force it to download the latest files)
